## About

IRC-Communicator project for Computer Networks at Poznan University of Technology. The application implements a text-based chat system, which is designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-on-one communication.

The main goal of this project was to implement IRC-Communicator TCP server in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [Java](https://www.java.com/) client, who can join the room, create new room, send message in room, receive messages from other users in room, leave the room or remove other users from own room. Client GUI was implemenented using [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/).

## Getting Started

### Server

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/filipciesielski7/IRC-Communicator.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the server directory
   ```
   cd src/server
   ```
3. Run this command to compile server:
   ```
   gcc -pthread server.c -o server -Wall
   ```
4. After server is compiled you can now run it using:
   ```
   ./server <port number> lub ./server (by default port 1234).
   ```

### Client

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line, type `mvn clean javafx:run` in `src/client` directory or import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any Maven project.
